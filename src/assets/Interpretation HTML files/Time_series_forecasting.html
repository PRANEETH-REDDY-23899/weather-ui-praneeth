<h2>Time series forecasting</h2>
<p> 
    Time series forecasting is one of the most applied data science techniques in
     business, finance, supply chain management, production and inventory planning.
      Many prediction problems involve a time component and thus require extrapolation
       of time series data, or time series forecasting. 
       Time series forecasting is also an important area of machine learning (ML) 
       and can be cast as a supervised learning problem. 
       ML methods such as Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, 
       Random Forests and XGBoost can be applied to it. Forecasting involves 
       taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future 
       observations. 
</p>
<p>
    Time series forecasting is an important business application of forecasting. 
    Practically everything a business or an enterprise does, requires prediction
     of the future requirements so that these can be budgeted for or planned for
      including sales, inputs/intermediates and manpower. Generating
       accurate and reliable forecasts is an important endeavour for many 
       organisations as it can lead to significant savings and cost reductions. 
       With the advent of sensor data and advanced data storage capabilities, 
       time series with higher sampling rates (sub-hourly, hourly, daily) are 
       becoming more common in many industries. 
</p>
<p>
    Time series forecasting can be used for weather forecasting. 
    Such series may exhibit complex seasonality patterns. 
    Forecasting that takes into account these patterns can have a significant 
    impact on accuracy and reliability of the weather forecast 
    both in the short run and over a longer horizon. Leading to more
     efficient resource and disaster management.
