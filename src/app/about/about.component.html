<h1> About the Project </h1>

<h2> A Teaching Tool </h2>
<p>Many students are interested in learning about Machine Learning. However, it can be difficult to grasp these topics and understand the differences between machine learning models. Moreover, lack of skills and resources can limit these students from conceptualizing the performance of such widely used models. Our application will facilitate and aid the learning process of students by modelling weather forecasting with various appropriate machine learning models and providing visualizations and interpretations for each model. </p>

<h2> Why Weather? </h2>
<p> We believe weather forecasting is ideal to help students learn about machine learning for a couple reasons. First, it is familiar to everyone; people often wonder what the weather will be like, and people are comfortable looking at visualizations forecasting the weather. Consequently, this allows people to understand and interpret how machine learning models can be used to model weather forecast. In addition, there are a wide range of available weather datasets and APIs with many different sets of features which can be utilized to learn ML models. This makes weather forecasting ideal for teaching students about the power and usefulness of machine learning. </p>

<h2> The Mesonet Dataset </h2>
<p> University at Albany is funded by the collaboration of State of New York and Department of Homeland Security and Emergency services to operate the NYS Early Warning Weather Detection System. We collected our data from their centerpiece <b> New York Mesonet </b>. The data consisted of organized weather information of 126 weather stations spread across the NY state. We requested and received the daily weather data ranging from 2018 to 2022. The data consisted of 42 attributes, broadly categorized into Temperature, Humidity, Precipitation, Pressure, Wind information, and Soil information.</p>
