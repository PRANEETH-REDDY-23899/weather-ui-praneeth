            <h1>Time Series Machine Learning Models</h1>

            <p class="text-muted">
              <p> 
                  Time series forecasting is one of the most applied data science techniques in
                  business, finance, supply chain management, production and inventory planning.
                    Many prediction problems involve a time component and thus require extrapolation
                    of time series data, or time series forecasting. 
                    Time series forecasting is also an important area of machine learning (ML) 
                    and can be cast as a supervised learning problem. 
                    ML methods such as Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, 
                    Random Forests and XGBoost can be applied to it. Forecasting involves 
                    taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future 
                    observations. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Time series forecasting is an important business application of forecasting. 
                  Practically everything a business or an enterprise does, requires prediction
                  of the future requirements so that these can be budgeted for or planned for
                    including sales, inputs/intermediates and manpower. Generating
                    accurate and reliable forecasts is an important endeavour for many 
                    organisations as it can lead to significant savings and cost reductions. 
                    With the advent of sensor data and advanced data storage capabilities, 
                    time series with higher sampling rates (sub-hourly, hourly, daily) are 
                    becoming more common in many industries. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Time series forecasting can be used for weather forecasting. 
                  Such series may exhibit complex seasonality patterns. 
                  Forecasting that takes into account these patterns can have a significant 
                  impact on accuracy and reliability of the weather forecast 
                  both in the short run and over a longer horizon. Leading to more
                  efficient resource and disaster management.

                  <p> 
                      Time series models are used to forecast events based on verified historical data. 
                      Common types include ARIMA, smooth-based, and moving average. Not all models will 
                      yield the same results for the same dataset, so it's critical to determine which 
                      one works best based on the individual time series.

              <section id="Autoregression">
                <h3>Autoregression</h3>
                <p class="text-muted">
                  <p>
    Autoregression is a time series model that uses observations from previous time 
    steps as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time 
    step. It is a very simple idea that can result in accurate forecasts on a range 
    of time series problems. A regression model, such as linear regression, models an
     output value based on a linear combination of input values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An autoregression model makes an assumption that the observations at 
                        previous time steps are useful to predict the value at the next time step. 
                        This relationship between variables is called correlation. If both variables 
                        change in the same direction (e.g. go up together or down together), this is 
                        called a positive correlation. If the variables move in opposite directions as 
                        values change (e.g. one goes up and one goes down), then this is called negative 
                        correlation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We can use statistical measures to calculate the correlation between the 
                        output variable and values at previous time steps at various different lags. 
                        The stronger the correlation between the output variable and a specific lagged 
                        variable, the more weight that autoregression model can put on that variable when 
                        modeling. Again, because the correlation is calculated between the variable and 
                        itself at previous time steps, it is called an autocorrelation. It is also called 
                        serial correlation because of the sequenced structure of time series data. The 
                        correlation statistics can also help to choose which lag variables will be useful 
                        in a model and which will not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We could calculate the linear regression model manually using the LinearRegession 
                        class in scikit-learn and manually specify the lag input variables to use. 
                        Alternately, the statsmodels library provides an autoregression model where you 
                        must specify an appropriate lag value and trains a linear regression model. 
                        It is provided in the AutoReg class. We can use this model by first creating 
                        the model AutoReg() and then calling fit() to train it on our dataset. 
                        This returns an AutoRegResults object. Once fit, we can use the model to make a 
                        prediction by calling the predict() function for a number of observations in 
                        the future.

                <h3> Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) </h3>
                <p class="text-muted">
                  <p>
                      Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model uses time-series data 
                      and statistical analysis to interpret the data and make future predictions. 
                      The ARIMA model aims to explain data by using time series data on its past values
                      and uses linear regression to make predictions.
                  </p> 

                  <p>
                  The following descriptive acronym explains the meaning of each of the key components of the ARIMA model:
                  1. The “AR” in ARIMA stands for autoregression, indicating that the model uses 
                  the dependent relationship between current data and its past values. 
                  In other words, it shows that the data is regressed on its past values. <br>
                  2. The “I” stands for integrated, which means that the data is stationary. 
                  Stationary data refers to time-series data that has been made “stationary” by 
                  subtracting the observations from the previous values. <br>
                  3. The “MA” stands for moving average model, indicating that the forecast or 
                  outcome of the model depends linearly on the past values. Also, it means that 
                  the errors in forecasting are linear functions of past errors. Note that the 
                  moving average models are different from statistical moving averages. <br>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      Equation 1:
                      $$y_t = I + \alpha_1 y_{t-1} + \alpha_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \alpha_p y_{t-p} + 
                      e_t + \theta_1 e_{t-1} + \theta_2 e_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q e_{t-q} $$ 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      Eq. (1) shows the parameter p is the number of autoregressive terms or the 
                      number of “lag observations.” It is also called the “lag order,” and it 
                      determines the outcome of the model by providing lagged data points. On the other 
                      hand, the parameter d is known as the degree of differencing. It indicates the 
                      number of times the lagged indicators have been subtracted to make the data 
                      stationary. Finally, the parameter q is the number of forecast errors in the 
                      model and is also referred to as the size of the moving average window. This is 
                      called the ARIMA(p, d, q) model. Estimating the coefficients alpha and theta for 
                      a given p, d, q is what ARIMA does when it learns from the training data in a time 
                      series. ACF and PACF plots can help to get an idea for p and q values.

                  <p>
                      Although ARIMA models can be highly accurate and reliable under the appropriate 
                      conditions and data availability, one of the key limitations of the model is 
                      that the parameters (p, d, q) need to be manually defined; therefore, 
                      finding the most accurate fit can be a long trial-and-error process. Similarly, 
                      the model depends highly on the reliability of historical data and the 
                      differencing of the data. It is important to ensure that data was collected 
                      accurately and over a long period of time so that the model provides accurate 
                      results and forecasts. More cons include: <br>
                  1. Exponential time complexity: When the value of p and q increases there 
                  are equally more coefficients to fit hence increasing the time complexity 
                  manifold if p and q are high. This makes ARIMA hard to put
                  into production and makes Data Scientists look into Prophet and other algorithms. 
                  Then again, it depends on the complexity of the dataset too. <br>
                  2. Complex data: There can be a possibility where your data is too complex and 
                  there is no optimal solution for p and q. Although highly unlikely that ARIMA would 
                  fail but if this occurs then unfortunately you may have to look elsewhere. <br>
                  3. Amount of data needed: Both the algorithms require considerable data to work on, 
                  especially if the data is seasonal. For example, using three years of historical 
                  demand is likely not to be enough (Short Life-Cycle Products) for a good forecast. <br>

                <h3>Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) </h3>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    <p>
                        Like ARIMA, SARIMA uses past values but also takes into account any seasonality 
                        patterns. Since SARIMA brings in seasonality as a parameter, it is 
                        significantly more powerful than ARIMA in forecasting complex data spaces 
                        containing cycles. SARIMA stands for Seasonal-ARIMA and it includes seasonality 
                        contribution to the forecast. The importance of seasonality is quite evident 
                        and ARIMA fails to encapsulate that information implicitly.

                    <p>
                        The Autoregressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA) parts of the 
                        model remain as that of ARIMA. The addition of seasonality adds robustness to the 
                        SARIMA model. It is represented by the non seasonal part (p, d ,q) and  the 
                        seasonal part (P, D, Q)m. Here m is the number of observations per year. 
                        We use the uppercase notation for the seasonal parts of the model, and 
                        lowercase notation for the non-seasonal parts of the model. Similar to ARIMA, 
                        the P,D,Q values for seasonal parts of the model can be deduced from the ACF 
                        and PACF plots of the data. SARIMA can be implemented with the same class as ARIMA 
                        by adding values to the seasonal order.

                        SARIMA has similar drawbacks as that of ARIMA.
