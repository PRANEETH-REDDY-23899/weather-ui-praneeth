              <h3> Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) </h3>
              <!-- <p class="text-muted"> -->
                <p>
                    Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model uses time-series data 
                    and statistical analysis to interpret the data and make future predictions. 
                    The ARIMA model aims to explain data by using time series data on its past values
                    and uses linear regression to make predictions.
                </p> 

                <p>
                The following descriptive acronym explains the meaning of each of the key components of the ARIMA model:
                1. The “AR” in ARIMA stands for autoregression, indicating that the model uses 
                the dependent relationship between current data and its past values. 
                In other words, it shows that the data is regressed on its past values. <br>
                2. The “I” stands for integrated, which means that the data is stationary. 
                Stationary data refers to time-series data that has been made “stationary” by 
                subtracting the observations from the previous values. <br>
                3. The “MA” stands for moving average model, indicating that the forecast or 
                outcome of the model depends linearly on the past values. Also, it means that 
                the errors in forecasting are linear functions of past errors. Note that the 
                moving average models are different from statistical moving averages. <br>
                </p>

                <!-- <p>
                    Equation 1:
                    $$y_t = I + \alpha_1 y_{t-1} + \alpha_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \alpha_p y_{t-p} + 
                    e_t + \theta_1 e_{t-1} + \theta_2 e_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q e_{t-q} $$ 
                </p> -->

                <p>
                    Eq. (1) shows the parameter p is the number of autoregressive terms or the 
                    number of “lag observations.” It is also called the “lag order,” and it 
                    determines the outcome of the model by providing lagged data points. On the other 
                    hand, the parameter d is known as the degree of differencing. It indicates the 
                    number of times the lagged indicators have been subtracted to make the data 
                    stationary. Finally, the parameter q is the number of forecast errors in the 
                    model and is also referred to as the size of the moving average window. This is 
                    called the ARIMA(p, d, q) model. Estimating the coefficients alpha and theta for 
                    a given p, d, q is what ARIMA does when it learns from the training data in a time 
                    series. ACF and PACF plots can help to get an idea for p and q values.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Although ARIMA models can be highly accurate and reliable under the appropriate 
                    conditions and data availability, one of the key limitations of the model is 
                    that the parameters (p, d, q) need to be manually defined; therefore, 
                    finding the most accurate fit can be a long trial-and-error process. Similarly, 
                    the model depends highly on the reliability of historical data and the 
                    differencing of the data. It is important to ensure that data was collected 
                    accurately and over a long period of time so that the model provides accurate 
                    results and forecasts. More cons include: <br>
                1. Exponential time complexity: When the value of p and q increases there 
                are equally more coefficients to fit hence increasing the time complexity 
                manifold if p and q are high. This makes ARIMA hard to put
                into production and makes Data Scientists look into Prophet and other algorithms. 
                Then again, it depends on the complexity of the dataset too. <br>
                2. Complex data: There can be a possibility where your data is too complex and 
                there is no optimal solution for p and q. Although highly unlikely that ARIMA would 
                fail but if this occurs then unfortunately you may have to look elsewhere. <br>
                3. Amount of data needed: Both the algorithms require considerable data to work on, 
                especially if the data is seasonal. For example, using three years of historical 
                demand is likely not to be enough (Short Life-Cycle Products) for a good forecast. <br>
